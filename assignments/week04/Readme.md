The stakeholders of the Snake game can be analyzed in layers using the onion model to ensure that all key needs are fully considered. The core layer includes direct stakeholders, such as players, developers, designers, and testers. Players need a smooth gaming experience, intuitive operations, and interesting gameplay; developers are responsible for programming and optimization of the game to ensure stable performance; designers focus on UI/UX design to make the game interface intuitive and beautiful; testers ensure that the game runs stably on different devices and fix potential problems. The middle layer involves indirect stakeholders, such as game operators and guardians. Operators (such as Steam and Google Play) are responsible for the distribution, promotion, and maintenance of the game, focusing on market performance, privacy compliance, and player feedback; guardians may be concerned about the gaming behavior of minors and expect the game to have parental control and anti-addiction mechanisms. The outer layer is external influencers, including regulators, advertisers, competitors, and game communities. Regulators ensure that games comply with data privacy, age rating, and advertising compliance requirements; advertisers focus on precise delivery to ensure that advertising does not affect user experience; competitors provide market competition pressure to encourage continuous optimization and innovation of games; the game community is composed of live broadcast players, forum users, etc., who influence game improvements through feedback and increase game awareness through social promotion. Overall, this stakeholder analysis method helps the development team to accurately identify needs, optimize game design, and improve market competitiveness, so that the game can both meet player needs and develop in the market in the long term.
