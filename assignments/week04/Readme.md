The stakeholders of the Snake game can be analyzed in layers using the **onion model** to ensure that all key needs are fully considered. 
The core layer includes direct stakeholders, such as **players**, **developers**, **designers**, and **testers**.
**Players** need a smooth gaming experience, intuitive operations, and interesting gameplay; **developers** are responsible for programming and optimization of the game to ensure stable performance;
**designers** focus on game flow and UI/UX design to make the game interface intuitive and beautiful;
**testers** ensure that the game runs stably on different devices and fix potential problems. The middle layer involves indirect stakeholders, such as **game operators** and **guardians**. **Operators** (such as Steam and Google Play) are responsible for the distribution, promotion, and maintenance of the game, focusing on market performance, privacy compliance, and player feedback;
**guardians** may be concerned about the gaming behavior of minors and expect the game to have parental control and anti-addiction mechanisms. 
The outer layer is external influencers, including **regulators**, **advertisers**, **competitors**, and **game communities**. **Regulators** ensure that games comply with data privacy, age rating, and advertising compliance requirements; **advertisers** focus on precise delivery to ensure that advertising does not affect user experience; **competitors** provide market competition pressure to encourage continuous optimization and innovation of games; the **game community** is composed of live broadcast players, forum users, etc., who influence game improvements through feedback and increase game awareness through social promotion. Overall, this stakeholder analysis method helps the development team to accurately identify needs, optimize game design, and improve market competitiveness, so that the game can both meet player needs and develop in the market in the long term.

# Reflection
During the process of defining **epics and user stories** for our **Snake Game**, our team gained valuable insights into requirement engineering and product planning. Here are the key lessons learned:  
1. **How to Define a Clear User Story?**  
   We learned that a well-defined **user story** should follow the **As a [user], I want to [goal] so that [reason]** format. This structure helped us ensure clarity and **user-centric design**. For instance, defining *‚ÄúAs a player, I want to control the snake using touch or keyboard so that I can play easily‚Äù* made it explicit who the user is, what they need, and why it matters. We also realized that **breaking large epics into smaller, independent user stories** improves task allocation and implementation feasibility.  
2. **How to Determine Acceptance Criteria?**  
   Writing **clear acceptance criteria** was crucial to ensuring that each feature is properly implemented and tested. We followed the **Given-When-Then** structure to define testable outcomes. For example, for the **three different map modes**, we specified:  
   - *Given the player selects the swamp map, When they start the game, Then the terrain should include water hazards slowing down the snake.*  
   - *Given the player selects the desert map, When they play, Then food should appear less frequently, increasing difficulty.*  
   - *Given the player selects the teleport map, When the snake moves to a teleportation point, Then it should reappear on the opposite side of the screen.*  
   This approach made it easier for testers and developers to validate functionality against defined requirements.  
3. **How to Fit These Requirements into the Context of the Application?**  
   One major challenge was ensuring that our **user stories aligned with the overall game experience**. We had to balance **technical feasibility, gameplay mechanics, and user needs**. For instance, implementing **in-game reward prompts** required designing an intuitive notification system to guide players when they achieve milestones. Additionally, ensuring **historical gameplay records** were saved properly allowed players to review their past performances and track their progress over time. Prioritizing features using **MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won‚Äôt-have)** helped us focus on essential functionality first, ensuring a smooth development process.  
### **Final Thoughts**  
By systematically breaking down **epics into user stories**, setting **clear acceptance criteria**, and aligning requirements with the **game‚Äôs objectives**, we enhanced both **gameplay design and development efficiency**. This structured approach not only improved team collaboration but also ensured that we built a **fun, accessible, and engaging Snake Game experience** for all players.
