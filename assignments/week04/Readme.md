The stakeholders of the Snake game can be analyzed in layers using the **onion model** to ensure that all key needs are fully considered. 
The core layer includes direct stakeholders, such as **players**, **developers**, **designers**, and **testers**.
**Players** need a smooth gaming experience, intuitive operations, and interesting gameplay; **developers** are responsible for programming and optimization of the game to ensure stable performance;
**designers** focus on game flow and UI/UX design to make the game interface intuitive and beautiful;
**testers** ensure that the game runs stably on different devices and fix potential problems. The middle layer involves indirect stakeholders, such as **game operators** and **guardians**. **Operators** (such as Steam and Google Play) are responsible for the distribution, promotion, and maintenance of the game, focusing on market performance, privacy compliance, and player feedback;
**guardians** may be concerned about the gaming behavior of minors and expect the game to have parental control and anti-addiction mechanisms. 
The outer layer is external influencers, including **regulators**, **advertisers**, **competitors**, and **game communities**. **Regulators** ensure that games comply with data privacy, age rating, and advertising compliance requirements; **advertisers** focus on precise delivery to ensure that advertising does not affect user experience; **competitors** provide market competition pressure to encourage continuous optimization and innovation of games; the **game community** is composed of live broadcast players, forum users, etc., who influence game improvements through feedback and increase game awareness through social promotion. Overall, this stakeholder analysis method helps the development team to accurately identify needs, optimize game design, and improve market competitiveness, so that the game can both meet player needs and develop in the market in the long term.
