# Two ideas of the game
### 1. Side-Scrolling Platformer Game

Players control a character to jump, move, and navigate through side-scrolling platforms, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies to reach the end goal. Inspired by classic games like Super Mario and I Wanna, the game emphasizes level design. Maps will feature diverse terrains, mechanisms, enemies, and even hidden areas, requiring players to utilize the character's jumping abilities and items to solve puzzles and complete levels. Innovative additions could include a level editor, allowing players to create their own stages, as well as a competitive or cooperative two-player mode where the first to reach the goal wins or both players must collaborate to succeed. The main development challenges involve precise collision detection and integrating a physics engine in p5.js to achieve realistic jumping and collision effects, especially in complex-level designs. Additionally, balancing the level design requires extensive testing and adjustments to ensure the game is both challenging and enjoyable.

### 2. Snake Game

Unlike traditional Snake games, this version leverages p5.js's mouse interaction capabilities, allowing players to control the snake's direction with their mouse. The snake moves toward the mouse pointer, and players must guide it to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls. Inspired by the classic Snake game, this version introduces a new dimension of control through mouse input. Innovative features include utilizing p5.js's graphics capabilities to design diverse food types and special power-ups, such as speed boosts, slowdowns, and invisibility. A multiplayer mode could also be added, enabling multiple players to compete on the same screen or introducing AI-controlled snakes to compete against the player, enhancing interactivity and fun. Development challenges include ensuring smooth snake movement and precise collision detection to avoid errors. Additionally, designing the
