# Final Idea
Since the Snake game aligns perfectly with the p5.js platform, we have chosen it as our final project. This Snake game innovates on the classic gameplay by introducing both single-player and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the game features an endless format where players freely control the snake's direction using the mouse, aiming to survive as long as possible while avoiding attacks from AI-controlled snakes. The AI snakes shoot bullets at the player, with body hits causing low damage and headshots dealing high damage. Players must avoid colliding with map obstacles, boundaries, or the bodies of AI snakes, and the game ends if their health drops to zero. In multiplayer mode, players control their snakes using the keyboard with eight-directional movement, and the game ends when one player fails (by hitting walls, colliding with another snake, or losing all health), declaring the other player the winner. The game incorporates roguelike elements, offering a variety of food types, such as buffs like sugar (slowing down) and cookies (revealing more food locations), as well as debuffs like trash (reducing health or speeding up). The art design can be directly implemented using p5.js without the need for additional third-party textures. Development challenges include achieving smooth mouse controls, precise collision detection, and designing intelligent behaviors for the AI snakes, while also balancing food effects and game pacing to ensure a fun and challenging experience.
