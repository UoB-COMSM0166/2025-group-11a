## Idea1:Platformer games
Game List:  
Super Mario Bros.  
Celeste  
Hollow Knight  

Game Overview  
Platformer games are a classic genre where players control a character that navigates various levels by jumping between platforms, avoiding obstacles, and defeating enemies. These games often test players' reflexes, precision, and problemsolving skills. Some platformers focus on exploration, while others emphasize fastpaced movement and tight platforming mechanics.  

Game Mechanics  

1. Game Objectives  
Players must progress through levels by jumping across platforms, avoiding hazards, and defeating or bypassing enemies. The ultimate goal is to reach the end of each level, with some games featuring boss fights or collectibles that unlock special rewards. As the game advances, level designs become more challenging, requiring precise movements and strategic use of mechanics.  

2. Character Abilities  
Basic Movement: Walking, running, and jumping form the core of movement mechanics.  
Wall Jump: Allows players to jump off walls to reach higher platforms.  
Dash: A quick burst of movement in any direction, useful for dodging attacks or crossing large gaps.  
Double Jump: Grants an extra jump midair, allowing for more control and recovery.  
Climbing: Some games allow players to grab onto ledges or climb walls for better vertical movement.  
Special Abilities: Players can unlock unique skills as they progress, such as:  
Glide: Slows descent, helping with precise landings.  
Ground Pound: A powerful downward attack that can break certain platforms or stun enemies.  
Grappling Hook: Lets players swing across gaps or pull themselves toward objects.  

3. Level Design  
Platform Variety: Platforms can be static, moving, disappearing, or interactable (e.g., pressing switches to activate bridges).  
Hazards and Obstacles:  
Spikes, lava, bottomless pits, and moving saw blades.  
Crumbling platforms that disappear after stepping on them.  
Wind zones that push the player in different directions.  
Environmental Challenges:  
Ice Levels: Slippery surfaces that make movement harder.  
Underwater Sections: Limited movement and slower jumps.  
Dark Levels: Reduced visibility, requiring light sources or memorybased navigation.  
Checkpoints: Players can restart from a checkpoint instead of beginning from the start of the level when they die.  

4. Resource Management  
Health System:  
Some platformers use a "onehit death" system, while others provide multiple hit points.  
Players may collect hearts or health packs to restore HP.  
Collectibles:  
Coins, gems, or special items can be collected for points, powerups, or unlocking secret levels.  
Some collectibles can enhance abilities, like increasing jump height or dash range.  
Lives and Respawns:  
Players have a limited number of lives, and losing all of them results in a game over.  
Some games have infinite retries, but deaths might reset progress within a level.  

5. Enemy Types  
Basic Enemies: Slowmoving and easy to defeat, often found in large numbers.  
Flying Enemies: Move unpredictably and require careful timing to avoid or attack.  
Chasing Enemies: Actively follow the player, forcing fast reactions.  
Large Enemies: Stronger foes with unique attack patterns, sometimes requiring multiple hits to defeat.  
Stage Bosses: Require pattern recognition and precise movement to defeat, often with multiple attack phases.  

6. Game Difficulty and Challenges  
Platformer games can range from beginnerfriendly to extremely difficult, depending on movement mechanics and level design. Challenges increase through:  
More complex platforming sections requiring precise timing.  
Fastermoving obstacles and enemies.  
Limited resources, forcing players to carefully manage their jumps and abilities.  
Hidden secrets and alternate paths, encouraging exploration.  


## Idea2:Advanced Snake Game  
Game List:  
Classic Snake (Nokia)  
Slither.io  
Snake Pass  

Game Overview  
Snake games revolve around controlling a growing snake that moves across a playfield, consuming items to grow while avoiding collisions. The classic version features simple movement mechanics, but modern adaptations introduce various gameplay twists, such as multiplayer competition, puzzlesolving, and environmental interactions.  

Game Mechanics  

1. Game Objectives  
Players control a snake that moves continuously in one direction. The goal is to collect food to grow longer while avoiding obstacles, the game boundaries, and selfcollisions. The longer the snake grows, the harder it becomes to maneuver. Some variations include additional objectives, such as surviving against AI opponents, completing challenges, or navigating mazelike levels.  

2. Snake Movement and Controls  
Classic Movement: The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, right) with smooth or gridbased controls.  
Curved Movement: Some modern versions allow for smooth turning, making movement feel more fluid.  
Speed Boost: Players can temporarily speed up at the cost of shrinking slightly or consuming energy.  
Growth Mechanics: The snake grows in length with each item collected, making movement more challenging.  

3. Level Design  
Classic Mode: An open field with no boundaries or obstacles.  
Maze Mode: Players navigate through narrow pathways while growing, requiring precise movement.  
Arena Mode: AIcontrolled or multiplayer snakes compete in a confined space.  
Moving Obstacles: Some levels feature shifting barriers, forcing constant adaptation.  
Dynamic Terrain: Water slows down movement, ice makes turning harder, etc.  

4. PowerUps and Items  
Growth Items: Standard food that increases the snake’s length.  
Shrink Items: Rare items that shorten the snake, helping with maneuverability.  
Speed Boosts: Temporarily increases movement speed but adds risk.  
Invincibility: Allows the snake to pass through itself or obstacles for a short time.  
Magnet PowerUp: Automatically attracts food items within a certain radius.  

5. Game Modes  
Endless Mode: The game continues until the snake crashes or reaches a maximum length.  
Time Attack: Players must grow as much as possible within a time limit.  
Puzzle Mode: Players navigate predesigned mazes to collect all items without getting trapped.  
Battle Mode: Compete against AI snakes or other players, trying to outgrow or trap them.  

6. Enemy and AI Behavior  
AI Snakes: Compete for food and try to block the player’s path.  
Moving Obstacles: Blocks that shift positions over time.  
Trap Zones: Areas that temporarily lock the player inside, forcing careful navigation.  

7. Game Difficulty and Challenges  
Increasing game speed over time.  
More complex level layouts with hazards.  
AI snakes with different movement patterns and aggression levels.  
Limited special abilities, requiring strategic usage.
