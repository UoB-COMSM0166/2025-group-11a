This project draws inspiration from one of the most iconic classic games‚Äî**Snake**. However, in contrast to the traditional version, which restricts player movement to four directional keys (up, down, left, right), our goal was to provide a more fluid and intuitive control system on the PC platform. Inspired by the mobile game Snake Battle, where players use a virtual joystick to control the snake's direction, we designed our version to allow players to guide the snake using mouse input. The **p5.js** library proved to be particularly suitable for this purpose, as it enables precise mouse-based direction control and allows for the snake's body to be dynamically rendered using overlapping circles, eliminating the need for external sprite assets.

To enhance the game's playability, we introduced a variety of **power-up food items**. When consumed, these items grant temporary buffs such as increased food collection range, short-term invincibility, or enhanced stamina for acceleration. Additionally, we designed multiple **maps and difficulty levels**, each incorporating unique gameplay mechanics. For example, swamp terrain reduces movement speed, fog limits visibility, and teleportation portals allow for quick relocation to different areas of the map.

An important feature of the game is the inclusion of **AI-controlled snakes** that compete with the player for food. To maintain balance and competitiveness, AI snakes drop food upon death. Since any collision between a snake's head and a non-food object results in death, players can strategically eliminate AI opponents to gain additional resources.

### Ideation Process

Each member of our team independently researched game types they were personally interested in. We then came together to share and discuss our findings, evaluating each proposed concept based on feasibility, alignment with team members‚Äô interests, and the potential for scalability within the scope of our project. Through this scoring process, two game types emerged as the highest-rated: side-scrolling platformers and arcade-style games, with Snake as a representative example.

Ultimately, we chose Snake as the foundation for our project. Our primary objective was to focus on enhancing our coding skills and gameplay design abilities, rather than investing a large portion of our time in level or map design, which would have been a significant part of a platformer. The simplicity and extensibility of Snake aligned well with our goal to experiment with control schemes, AI behavior, and game mechanics.

During the ideation phase, we also referenced modern adaptations of the classic Snake game, such as Slither.io and Snake Battle, which inspired us to explore mouse-based controls, dynamic gameplay elements, and multiplayer mechanics. We held structured brainstorming sessions using collaborative tools to consolidate ideas and assess the technical feasibility of each concept, especially within the capabilities of the p5.js library.

Additionally, you may notice that our team was divided into two subgroups, 11a and 11b. This decision arose during the this stage, as we encountered fundamental differences in creative direction that proved difficult to reconcile. To ensure smooth progress and allow each group to pursue its own vision effectively, we mutually agreed to split into two sub-teams and continue the development of two game projects independently.

### User Stories
To clarify the features we could realistically implement and to prioritize our development tasks, we discussed and formulated a series of user stories. The full list can be found in our [week 4 assignment](https://uob-comsm0166.github.io/2025-group-11a/assignments/week04). Below are several key stories that had a significant impact on the final deliverable:

> "As a player, I want to control the snake using touch or keyboard so that I can play easily."

>‚ÄúAs a player, I want different map modes, such as swamp, desert, and teleportation, each with unique characteristics, so that I can experience varied gameplay.‚Äù

>‚ÄúAs a player, I want to adjust the game difficulty to match different challenge levels.‚Äù

>‚ÄúAs a player, I want a timed mode where I can achieve the highest score within a limited time.‚Äù

In addition to player-centered stories, we also created developer and UI designer stories to guide the project from a broader perspective:

> "As a developer, I want to implement modular managers (e.g., FoodManager, ObstacleManager, ItemManager) so that we can maintain and expand different gameplay elements independently."

> "As a developer, I want to implement AI snakes that can track, shoot at, and avoid the player, so the game has an engaging and competitive challenge."

> "As a designer, I want to create a multi-step start menu (snake customization ‚Üí map ‚Üí difficulty), so players are guided smoothly into the game."

> "As a designer, I want to implement a victory and game-over screen with reasons (e.g., timeout, collision), so that players receive clear feedback."

In designing user stories for our Snake Game, we adopted the ‚ÄúAs a [user], I want to [goal] so that [reason]‚Äù structure to ensure clarity and player-centered design. This method helped us define features that directly address user needs and align with gameplay experience. 

We also emphasized writing clear, testable acceptance criteria using the Given-When-Then format. For example, selecting the swamp map slows the snake with water hazards, while the desert mode increases difficulty by reducing food frequency. The teleportation mode repositions the snake across the screen, adding a unique twist. These outcomes help validate functionality effectively during development.

Importantly, we ensured that all user stories were feasible and supported gameplay diversity. Using frameworks like MoSCoW, we prioritized features and focused development on delivering a smooth, engaging experience. This systematic approach improved collaboration and guaranteed a balanced, player-friendly design.

### Early Stages Design

</p>
<p align="center">Image 5: Prototype</p>


To align with our development approach, we referred to the mobile game Snake Battle as our primary design inspiration. Although Snake Battle is a multiplayer online game, our target platform does not support multiplayer functionality. As a result, we had to explore alternative gameplay mechanics to enhance player engagement.

In the early stages of design, we proposed incorporating roguelike elements, including various buff and debuff items‚Äîsuch as candy (which grants a temporary speed boost), cookies (which reveal additional food locations), and trash (which causes damage or unexpected acceleration). We also considered implementing both single-player and two-player modes.

However, as development progressed, we realized that these ideas deviated from the core essence of the classic Snake game and introduced ambiguity in the win conditions, which undermined gameplay consistency. Therefore, we decided to retain only the buff system and the single-player mode, while continuously re-evaluating new gameplay ideas through weekly iteration and testing.

In the first sprint (initial deliverable version), our focus was on faithfully recreating the core mechanics of the reference game: the snake is controlled using the mouse to navigate, consuming food increases its length and score, and the game ends if the snake collides with the map boundary or any obstacle. To increase the level of challenge, we added AI-controlled snakes and obstacles to the map. A collision between the player's snake head and an AI snake‚Äôs body also results in game over. AI snakes compete with the player for food, and in hard mode, food dropped upon the death of AI snakes becomes a crucial scoring resource.

### Use-Case Diagram
<div align="center">

    <p>Image 6: Use-Case Diagram<br>
</div>
We used a use case diagram to preliminarily identify the functional components of the game, helping to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the required features. During this phase, we held discussions to determine the key use cases of the game and how players would interact with each component. Players engage with the game through a linear interaction flow, starting from a specific screen shown after selecting "Start Game", after which they can choose a map and a difficulty mode. This design allows players to become familiar with the game before challenging themselves further.

In addition, each difficulty mode is associated with its own set of components. As players progress, these components increase the challenge within each mode. For instance, the ‚ÄúSwamp‚Äù map may extend into a ‚ÄúSlow Speed‚Äù challenge, while the ‚ÄúDesert‚Äù map could introduce a ‚ÄúReduced Visibility‚Äù mechanic. During gameplay, players are able to move, gain scores, and collect buff items, but may also die if they encounter obstacles.

This use case diagram focuses solely on the game‚Äôs core gameplay functionality and supports the implementation of the features discussed in the early design phase. Since we adopted an agile development methodology, numerous additional features were introduced later in the project‚Äîsuch as pause functionality, sound effects, and more refined AI snake movement. All of these were integrated without disrupting the structure of the original use case diagram, which continued to serve as a foundation for iterative improvements.

### Requirements Definition
We conduct weekly requirement reviews based on the current state of the game to gather additional player feedback, refine gameplay mechanics, and address bugs. This iterative process is also reflected in our Kanban board. The finalized requirements for the deliverable version are as follows: <br>

**1. Game Objective <br>**
The main goal of the game is for the player to control a snake and consume randomly generated food on the map. The player must reach a target score within a limited time in order to win.

**2. Player Controls <br>**
The snake‚Äôs direction is controlled using the mouse. <br>
The player can accelerate the snake by holding the left mouse button. Acceleration consumes stamina, which is limited and regenerates over time or through specific items.

**3. Core Gameplay Mechanics <br>**
Each time the snake consumes a piece of food, its body length increases and the score is incremented. <br>
If the player defeats an AI-controlled snake by colliding with it using their snake‚Äôs body (not head), the AI snake is destroyed and additional food or special items are dropped. <br>
The game ends immediately if the player's snake collides with the edge of the map, any obstacles, or the head/body of an AI snake.

**4. Power-Ups and Items <br>**
Several power-up items are introduced to enhance gameplay. <br>
**Charge Boost**: Instantly refills the stamina bar, allowing the player to accelerate again. <br>
**Invincibility**: Grants temporary immunity to collisions with obstacles and AI snakes. However, the player can still die if they collide with the edge of the map. <br>
**Foraging Radius Increase**: Temporarily enlarges the effective area around the snake‚Äôs head for collecting food, making it easier to gather items.

**5. Map Variations and Environmental Effects <br>**
To introduce variety and challenge, the game includes multiple map modes, each with unique effects. <br>
**Swamp Map**: When the snake moves through swamp terrain, its movement speed decreases, and acceleration is less effective. <br>
**Desert Map**: Occasional sandstorms obscure the player's vision, making navigation more difficult. <br>
**Teleportation Map**: Teleportation portals allow the snake to instantly travel to different locations on the map, enabling strategic repositioning. <br>

**6. Difficulty Modes <br>**
**Normal Mode**: Designed for casual gameplay, this mode includes a moderate number of AI snakes, a balanced distribution of obstacles, and a standard amount of food items across the map. <br>
**Hard Mode**: Intended for experienced players seeking a challenge. In this mode, the game initializes with a significantly higher number of AI-controlled snakes, increased obstacles scattered throughout the map, and a reduced frequency of food item spawns. This setting requires more strategic movement and resource management to succeed.

**7. Win and Loss Conditions <br>**
**Victory Condition**: The player wins the game by achieving the target score within the allotted time limit. <br>
**Defeat Conditions**: The player loses if they fail to reach the target score in time, or if their snake collides with the map boundary, any obstacle, or an AI-controlled snake.
